This is a library for transforming a point in two-dimensional space into a scalar Hilbert space filling curve value. More information about HSFC can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve.

The current implementation does not provide transformation from Hilbert curve value to a spatial point. Perhaps in feature versions, this would be implemented.
